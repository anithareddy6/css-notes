FLOAT AND CLEAR PROPERTIES:

FLOAT:LEFT;-it will add the below element to its side by side
 float property can be used to change the normal document flow by floating elements to the left or right side of its container

  .clear{clear:both;}-it will clear paragaraph if headings or paragraph available around the images

FLOAT AND COLLAPSED CONTAINER

  OVERFLOW
    overflow is actually used to specify how to display content that doesn't fit in its container

POSITION 
    Also used to change the flow of the document
    
STATIC:not positioned//it is a initial value which means elements are not positioned//
RELATIVE :relative to current position,and it will not affet other elements or box
ABSOLUTE:relative to containing element,elements with absolute positioning are relative to its closest positioned ancestor element,if that exist it relative to the body element
FIXED:relative to the viewport,it will stays in the same spot even on page scroll
STICKY:relative to containing element and viewport


GRID AND FLEXBOX-used to create layouts

FLEXBOX
 items are alligned on a single axis.flex box only deals with one dimension at a time which means it will arrange row at one same time or column at same time.it will not arrange both
GRID
 are layout of 2-dimensional because it can arrange into rows and columns at a same time

FLEX-DIRECTION
 Determines the direction of the main axis
 there are four values:row,row-reverse,column and column-reverse

FLEX-DIRECTION:ROW
-the main start 
-the main end
FLEX-WRAP:NOWRAP-meaning flex items will not wrap

FLEX PROPERTIES

  FLEX-BASIS-sets the initial size of the flex-items
  FLEX-GROW-determines how items will expand if there is extra space in the container
  FLEX-SHRINK-determines how item will shrink if there isnt enough space in the container
for more-refer mdm  

ALIGNING ITEMS IN A FLEX CONTAINER-useful when creating container with boxes
 
JUSTIFY-CONTENT aligns items on the main axis
ALIGN-ITEMS aligns items on the cross axis

 .box{
  display:flex;
  align-items:center;
  justify-content:center
 }

GRID

these below will create explicit grid
grid-template-columns
grid-template-rows

.grid-container{
  display:grid;
  grid-template-columns:100px 100px 100px;//3 columns//
  grid-template-rows:100px 100px;//2 rows//
}

The fraction unit:fr

same concept applies to rows and columns
fr:represnts a fraction of the available space in the grid container
 grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr 1fr;-it will all the 3 elements space equally
 grid-template-columns:1fr 2fr 1fr;-it will take twice the amount of first and third track in 2 column
  
REPEAT()

repeat([number of tracks],[size of tracks])

grid -template-columns:1fr 1fr 1fr;
//same as//
grid-template-columns:repeat(3,1fr);

grid-template-columns:50px repeat(2,1 fr)-our first column is 50px wide and next two columns are equally spaced

ADDING GUTTERS WITH GAP(GUTTERS-GAP INBETWEEN GRIDS)-not cdeclare with fr

gap:10px;//rows & columns//
gap:10px 20px;//rows|columns//

GAP-ROW AND GAP-COLUMN

//shorthand//
gap:10px 20px;

//longhand//
row-gap:10px;
column-gap:20px;

EXPLICIT GRID-only boxes  is explicit grid..not including extra spaces(explicit grids)
IMPLICIT GRID-extra spaces in the in container after box

 -if you dont know how many items your grid needss to display you can create whole grid using only an implicit grid
 -if you know the minimum amount of grid items you could use implicit and explicit grid together
 
IMPLICIT GRID

 grid-auto-columns
 grid-auto-rows

 .grid-container{
  display:grid;
  grid-auto-columns:repeat(3, 1fr);//3 columns//
  grid-auto-rows:100px 100px;//2 rows//
 }

 GRID PLACEMENT PROPERTIES

 POSITIONING GRID ITEMS-must be applied to the grid items to determine their placement in the grid
 
 grid-column =grid-column-start
             =grid-column-end
 grid-row=grid-row-start
         =grid-row-end

//longnghand//
.grid-item-1{
  grid-column-start: 2;
  grid-column-end:4;
}
//shorthand//
grid-column:2/4;

//longhand//
grid-row-start:1;
grid-row-end:3;
//shorthand//
grid-row:1/3;

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:

 Key ingredientd
  fluid layout
  flexible images
  media queries

  MEDIA QUERIES

  (@media-media rule),screen-(media type)max-width:1000px(media future)
   @media screen and (max-width:1000px)
   h1{
    font-size:16px;
   }

  MEDIA TYPES

  ALL-matches to all types
  print-matches to printers and print-related displays
  speech-matches to screen reading devices that"read out" a page
  screen-matches all devices that aren't categorized as print or speech

  @media all{..},media{..}-both queries target all media type

  @media print{..}
  @media speech{...}
  @media screen{...}

MEDIA FEATURES

 media features are used to test a specific feature of the device

@media(width: 480px){...}
@media (orientation :landscape){...}
 
 use keyword "and" to combine media features with media types

@media(orientation:landscape){...}
@media screen and (orientation landscape){...}

BREAKPOINTS

 320PX:mobile portrait
 480px:mobile landscape
 600px:small tablet
 768px:tablet portrait
 940-1024px:tablet landscape
 1280px and greater:desktop,laptop

 //exact width//
 @media (width:360px){...}

//mininum width-360px or larger//
@media (min-width:360px){...}

//maximum width-360px or smaller//
@media(max-width:360px){..}
.......
///800px and smaller//
@media (max-width:800px){...}

//800px and larger//
@media (min-width:800px){...}-the scondd comes declaration will take precedence

deskop first
//changes made for smaller screens//
@media(max-width:800px){body(...)}
@media(max-width:400px){body(..)}

mobile first
//changes made for larger screens//
@media(min-width:800px){body(..)}
@media{min-width:1200px}{body(..)}

create a range

//this applies a range of 400px to 800px//

@media(min-width:400px) and (max-width:800px){body(...)}
........................................................

position

/*1. static -basic default positioning poroperty(it will not change anything)
  2. relative-LTRB able to change change  (additional properties-left,top,right,bottom)
  3. absolute-box will come out totally out of parent box,to avoid this coming out of parent box,we will use position relative in main(additional properties-LTRB and  relative)
  4. fixed-in overall doc, we can able to fix the box anywhere
  5. sticky-when we scroll down means it will automattically come to up and when go to original position means it will go and stick in original position
